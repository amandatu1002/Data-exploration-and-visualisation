# Data Exploration and Visualisation

Data Exploration Project
What you can discover:
• How demand changes over the year?
• How price changes over the year? Does the price rise on weekends?
• What do Airbnb users care about?

Data Visualisation Project
An Interactive Visualization Website for Airbnb in Melbourne. This application is designed for Airbnb hosts or someone interested in Airbnb hosting. 
What you can discover:

2. The relationship between room type and area.
3. The key factor in the reviews and the relation of each word.
